For RHEL6/CentOS6 run the following to install the appropriate dependencies:
yum install epel-release;
yum install python-pip;
pip install --upgrade pip;
pip install requests;
pip install json;

If you are using other operating systems, read the following information:
To run this API script, Python will need to have the "requests" module available to it.
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

For information on installing the "requests" module: 
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#pip-install-requests

In addition to the above module, the script uses the "json" module
A similar pip command can be used to install json
